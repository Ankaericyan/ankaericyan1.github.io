        <p>Digital Avatar is a graphical illustration of a user or user’s character to perform a particular action. It can be a 2D icon, as we see across social media platforms/forums, or a 3D figure, as we see in games or virtual worlds. Although they were seen as an element of entertainment, many organizations around the world have started seeing their purpose across different fields like healthcare, advertising, and soft-skills development.</p>

          <h2>Healthcare</h2>
          <p>Digital Avatars are making its way in Healthcare to address various disorders and chronic conditions such as Autism, Hyperactivity, and Dementia to name a few. Many researchers across the world have been exploring patients’ reactions and attitudes towards their own Digital Twins. While a lot of research studies are still undergoing, it has been discovered that Digital Avatars can be used to teach social skills and interactions, especially to children with Autism.</p>

          <h2>Advertising</h2>
          <p>Due to the COVID19 pandemic, brands haven’t been able to shoot commercials. Following the COVID guidelines and norms, companies have come with the idea of using bobble-headed avatars to engage consumers. For example, the former Game of Thrones star, ‘Maisie Williams’ turned into a digital avatar as part of her new role as Global Sustainability Ambassador at H&M. COVID will eventually be reduced, however, the world of digital has exploded and it will never be the same again.</p>

          <h2>Gaming</h2>
          <p>Many video game companies have been using avatars for over a decade. Recently, Oculus announced that it has started rolling out new avatars across Oculus applications and Facebook products. According to the latest research by Dr. Muhammad Awais Shakir Goraya, a senior lecturer in operations and systems management from the Faculty of Business and Law suggests that experienced gamers get excited about the idea of seeing avatars in the virtual world as it gives them real-life experience.                                             </p>

          <h2>What is the future of Digital Avatars?</h2>
          <p>The proliferation of new technologies has changed the way we collaborate and communicate with our peers and friends. Although the ongoing pandemic has minimized our interactions with the outer world, digital avatars have paved the way for us to keep communicating, in a similar way to real-life experiences. </p>

            <h2>Online assistants</h2>
            <p>An avatar used by an automated online assistant providing customer service on a web page
              Avatars can be used as virtual embodiments of embodied agents, which are driven more or less by artificial intelligence rather than real people. Automated online assistants are examples of avatars used in this way.
              Such avatars are used by organizations as a part of automated customer services in order to interact with consumers and users of services. This can avail for enterprises to reduce their operating and training cost.A major underlying technology to such systems is natural language processing.Some of these avatars are commonly known as "bots". </p>

            <h2>Digital conversation </h2>
            <p>Avatars can also be powered by a digital conversation which provides a little more structure than those using NLP, offering the user options and clearly defined paths to an outcome. This kind of avatar is known as a Structured Language Processing or SLP Avatar.</p>

            <h2>Video game</h2>
            <p>Avatars in video games are the player's representation in the game world. The first video games to include a representation of the player were Basketball (1974) which represented players as humans,[20][21] and Maze War (1974) which represented players as eyeballs.
              In some games, the player's representation is fixed, however many games offer a basic character model, or template, and then allow customization of the physical features as the player sees fit.</p>

            <h2>Non-gaming online worlds</h2>
            <p>Avatars in non-gaming online worlds are used as two- or three-dimensional human or fantastic representations of a person's inworld self. Such representations are a tool which facilitates the exploration of the virtual universe, or acts as a focal point in conversations with other users, and can be customized by the user. Usually, the purpose and appeal of such universes is to provide a large enhancement to common online conversation capabilities, and to allow the user to peacefully develop a portion of a non-gaming universe without being forced to strive towards a pre-defined goal.</p>
